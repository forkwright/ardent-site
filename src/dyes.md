# Dyes

Dye soaks into leather. It doesn't coat it. The color becomes part of the hide.

These recipes use historical ingredients: plant matter, mineral mordants, time. Logwood, madder root, nettle, verdigris. The same materials that colored Roman boots and medieval manuscripts.

Each name names a condition, not just a color.

## Aima

<span class="dye-greek">Αἷμα · blood</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">HAI-mah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-aima"></span><span class="dye-hex">#581523</span>

Aima is not red. It is the cost of continuity.

Madder root, logwood, iron mordant. The same pigments that colored Roman boots and British saddlery. True oxbloods fade to rust unless correctly fixed. This one holds.

## Thanatochromia

<span class="dye-greek">Θανατοχρωμία · the color death leaves behind</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">tha-na-to-khro-MEE-ah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-thanatochromia"></span><span class="dye-hex">#2C1B3A</span>

A coined word. Greek grammar, new meaning. Imperial purple earned through transformation.

Logwood and iron mordant, layered until the depth holds. The same base chemistry that made Tyrian purple precious — though that required murex snails and imperial budgets. This version uses what the forest provides.

<div class="dye-entry dye-entry-aporia">

## Aporia

<span class="dye-greek">ἀπορία · the condition of being stuck between unresolvable truths</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">ah-po-REE-ah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-aporia"></span><span class="dye-hex">#5C8E63</span>

Green on leather was historically elusive. Most faded fast or turned brown. This version borrows stability from copper (verdigris, micro-dosed) and depth from nettle and logwood.

## Process

Botanical matter simmered for an hour. Strained. Iron mordant added gradually, watching the color shift as it oxidizes. Applied in thin coats by sponge or wool dauber, dried and buffed between layers. Thin coats over thick. Patience over speed.
