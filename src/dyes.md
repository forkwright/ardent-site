# Dyes

Dye soaks into leather. It doesn't coat it. The color becomes part of the hide.

These recipes use historical ingredients: plant matter, mineral mordants, time. Madder root, logwood, indigo, iron. The same materials that colored Roman boots and medieval manuscripts.

The names aren't colors. They're conditions - states of being that the color carries.

<div class="dye-entry dye-entry-aima">

## Aima

<span class="dye-greek" lang="el" translate="no">Αἷμα · blood</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">HAI-mah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-aima"></span>

The Greek word for blood. In ancient texts, αἷμα appears wherever sacrifice matters. Tied to lineage, to what was given so something else could continue. Blood is the cost of continuity.

Madder root, alum mordant, minimal iron afterbath. The traditional oxblood formula used madder with blood albumin to deepen the red. This version follows that chemistry. Over years it deepens, warming toward brown-burgundy as the pigments continue their slow oxidation.

<div class="dye-entry dye-entry-thanatochromia">

## Thanatochromia

<span class="dye-greek" lang="el" translate="no">Θανατοχρωμία · the color death leaves behind</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">tha-na-to-khro-MEE-ah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-thanatochromia"></span>

A coined word. θάνατος (death) + χρώμα (color). Neo-Greek, invented but grammatically correct. The concept needed a name.

Madder root with iron mordant. Iron transforms madder from red toward purple, a color shift that depends on the mordant's sacrifice. The same root, different outcome. It shifts over time toward gray-purple or brown-purple depending on light, darkening where hands touch most.

</div>

<div class="dye-entry dye-entry-aporia">

## Aporia

<span class="dye-greek" lang="el" translate="no">ἀπορία · the condition of being stuck between unresolvable truths</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">ah-po-REE-ah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-aporia"></span>

A philosophical term from Plato and Aristotle. The impasse when two truths contradict and neither yields. You can't resolve it. You can only be present inside it. Of the three, this word is closest to what Ardent is actually about.

Logwood base with iron, overdyed with indigo. The tension between iron (earth, permanence) and indigo (sky, transcendence), mediated by logwood. The color shifts between blue in bright light and purple in shadow. Green that breathes.

</div>

<div class="dye-entry dye-entry-natural">

## Natural

<span class="dye-greek" lang="el" translate="no">Φύσις · nature, the way things grow</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">FOO-sis</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-natural"></span>

Undyed [Hermann Oak](/materials/). The leather as it leaves the tannery, tallow-stuffed and full of potential.

Vegetable tannins darken with light and handling. The oils from your hands accelerate the change. Russet becomes amber becomes deep brown over years. Every mark evidence of the life you've lived together.

</div>

## Process

Botanical matter simmered for an hour, extracting pigment into water. Strained. Mordant applied to fix color into the leather's structure and prevent fading. The mordant determines the final color as much as the dye itself.

Applied in thin coats by sponge or wool dauber. Thin coats penetrate. Thick coats crack. Each layer dried and buffed before the next. The dye soaks into the hide's grain. This is not surface treatment.

No two batches are exactly alike. Each will age differently. The names are states, not specifications. Concepts the mind holds, not colors a machine matches.

<p class="specs">Hand-dyed pieces are released in limited batches.</p>
