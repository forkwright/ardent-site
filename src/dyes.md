# Dyes

Dye soaks into leather. It doesn't coat it. The color becomes part of the hide.

These recipes use historical ingredients: plant matter, mineral mordants, time. Logwood, madder root, nettle, verdigris. The same materials that colored Roman boots and medieval manuscripts.

Each name names a condition, not just a color.

## Aima

<span class="dye-greek">Αἷμα · blood</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">HAI-mah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-aima"></span><span class="dye-hex">#581523</span>

The Greek word for blood. In ancient texts, αἷμα appears wherever sacrifice matters. Tied to lineage, to what was given so something else could continue. Blood is the cost of continuity.

Madder root, logwood, iron mordant. True oxbloods fade to rust unless correctly fixed. This one holds.

## Thanatochromia

<span class="dye-greek">Θανατοχρωμία · the color death leaves behind</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">tha-na-to-khro-MEE-ah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-thanatochromia"></span><span class="dye-hex">#2C1B3A</span>

A coined word. θάνατος (death) + χρώμα (color). Neo-Greek, invented but grammatically correct. The concept needed a name.

Tyrian purple was made from crushed murex snails. The dye came from their death. Imperial purple earned through transformation. This version uses logwood and iron. Same chemistry, different source. The color death leaves behind.

<div class="dye-entry dye-entry-aporia">

## Aporia

<span class="dye-greek">ἀπορία · the condition of being stuck between unresolvable truths</span>
<span class="dye-pronunciation">ah-po-REE-ah</span>

<span class="dye-swatch swatch-aporia"></span><span class="dye-hex">#5C8E63</span>

A philosophical term from Plato and Aristotle. ἀπορία names the impasse when two truths contradict and neither yields. The only way through is abstraction. Recurse. Hold both as true while accepting that coherence requires moving up a level. Of the three, this word is closest to Ardent's core.

Green on leather was historically elusive. Most greens faded fast or turned brown. Caught between color and decay. This version borrows stability from copper (verdigris, micro-dosed) and depth from nettle and logwood.

## Process

Botanical matter simmered for an hour. Strained. Iron mordant added gradually, watching the color shift as it oxidizes. Applied in thin coats by sponge or wool dauber, dried and buffed between layers. Thin coats over thick. Patience over speed.
