<h1 data-greek="Λεξικόν"><span>Lexicon</span></h1>

The substrate beneath the work. External frames that shape how attention is given.

<h2 id="proofs">[Proofs and Refutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_and_Refutations)</h2>

*Imre Lakatos, 1976*

Mathematics isn't discovered, it's constructed through conjecture and criticism. The process of proving is the proof. Theorems aren't found but forged through dialogue — conjecture, counterexample, revision. Knowledge emerges from the struggle, not despite it.

Directly informs *process as proof*: the work carries evidence of its making. The stitches are the argument.

<h2 id="stoner">[Stoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_(novel))</h2>

*John Williams, 1965*

A quiet life fully lived. William Stoner teaches literature at a provincial university, suffers a difficult marriage, experiences small triumphs and failures. The prose is plain; the attention is total. Every detail inevitable because it was attended to.

Not performing depth — being deep. The kind of presence where the work simply becomes right because someone was fully there for it.

---

<h2 id="wabi-sabi">[Wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi)</h2>

*Japanese aesthetic tradition, rooted in Zen Buddhism*

The beauty of impermanence, imperfection, and incompleteness. Derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence. *Wabi* originally meant the loneliness of living in nature; *sabi* meant "cold" or "withered."

What ages, wears, shows use is beautiful not despite the marks of time but because of them. Patina is a feature. Scars tell stories. The perfectly imperfect is more honest than the flawless.

---

<h2 id="shibumi">[Shibumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui)</h2>

*Japanese aesthetic tradition*

Understated elegance, quiet complexity. *Shibui* objects appear simple but reward sustained attention — the more you look, the more you find. Related to but distinct from wabi-sabi; where wabi-sabi embraces decay, shibumi embraces restraint.

Complexity that presents as simplicity. The work that looks effortless because the effort was spent getting it right, not looking impressive. Direct restraint over ornamentation.

---

<h2 id="negative-capability">[Negative Capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability)</h2>

*John Keats, letter to his brothers, December 1817*

"When a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason." Keats coined the term to describe Shakespeare's genius — the ability to inhabit contradiction without forcing resolution.

The ability to sit with not-knowing. To hold opposites without collapsing them. Why *Aporia* is a dye color: the conundrum itself has beauty. Some questions are meant to be lived, not answered.

---

<h2 id="the-greek">[Attic Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_Greek)</h2>

*The dialect of Classical Athens, 5th–4th century BCE*

The language of Plato, Aristotle, the tragedians. Not decoration — precision. Greek was built for philosophical exactness in ways English flattens. Compound words carry their etymology visibly; meaning assembles from parts.

χείρ (cheir) — *the hand that makes*. Root of χειρουργός (cheirourgos), hand-worker, surgeon.

μνήμη (mneme) — memory as monument. What remains. Root of mnemonic.

προσοχή (prosoche) — attention as *toward-holding*. πρός (toward) + ἔχω (to hold).

The structure invites precision that translation loses. θανατοχρωμία — death-color. ἡμερολόγιον — day-account. Each word a small philosophy.

---

<h2 id="ladder">[Ladder of Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_of_abstraction)</h2>

*S.I. Hayakawa, Language in Action, 1939*

Language operates at levels from concrete to abstract. "Bessie the cow" is concrete; "livestock" is abstract; "wealth" more abstract still. Each level loses detail but gains generality. Clear thinking requires moving deliberately between levels — knowing when to zoom in and when to zoom out. Muddy thinking happens when levels are confused.

Directly informs how work should function at multiple layers simultaneously. A belt is leather (concrete), an heirloom (abstract), attention made material (more abstract). Each layer true, none contradicting.

---

<h2 id="ardere">[Ardere](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ardere)</h2>

*Latin*

To burn. Not passion as emotion — passion as what survives testing. The name compresses: what remains after fire has tested it.

Root of ardent, ardor, arson. To burn is to transform irreversibly. What comes through the fire is changed but proved.
