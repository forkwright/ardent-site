<h1 data-greek="Λεξικόν"><span>Lexicon</span></h1>

The substrate beneath the work. External frames that shape how attention is given.

---

<h2 id="proofs">[Proofs and Refutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_and_Refutations)</h2>

*Imre Lakatos, 1976*

Mathematics isn't discovered, it's constructed through conjecture and criticism. The process of proving is the proof. Theorems aren't found but forged through dialogue — conjecture, counterexample, revision. Knowledge emerges from the struggle, not despite it.

Directly informs *process as proof*: the work carries evidence of its making. The stitches are the argument.

---

<h2 id="stoner">[Stoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_(novel))</h2>

*John Williams, 1965*

A quiet life fully lived. William Stoner teaches literature at a provincial university, suffers a difficult marriage, experiences small triumphs and failures. The prose is plain; the attention is total. Every detail inevitable because it was attended to.

Not performing depth — being deep. The kind of presence where the work simply becomes right because someone was fully there for it.

---

<h2 id="wabi-sabi">[Wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi)</h2>

*Japanese aesthetic tradition, rooted in Zen Buddhism*

The beauty of impermanence, imperfection, and incompleteness. Derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence. *Wabi* originally meant the loneliness of living in nature; *sabi* meant "cold" or "withered."

What ages, wears, shows use is beautiful not despite the marks of time but because of them. Patina is a feature. Scars tell stories. The perfectly imperfect is more honest than the flawless.

---

<h2 id="shibumi">[Shibumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui)</h2>

*Japanese aesthetic tradition*

Understated elegance, quiet complexity. *Shibui* objects appear simple but reward sustained attention — the more you look, the more you find. Related to but distinct from wabi-sabi; where wabi-sabi embraces decay, shibumi embraces restraint.

Complexity that presents as simplicity. The work that looks effortless because the effort was spent getting it right, not looking impressive. Direct restraint over ornamentation.

---

<h2 id="negative-capability">[Negative Capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability)</h2>

*John Keats, letter to his brothers, December 1817*

"When a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason." Keats coined the term to describe Shakespeare's genius — the ability to inhabit contradiction without forcing resolution.

The ability to sit with not-knowing. To hold opposites without collapsing them. Why *Aporia* is a dye color: the conundrum itself has beauty. Some questions are meant to be lived, not answered.

---

<h2 id="the-greek">[Attic Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_Greek)</h2>

*The dialect of Classical Athens, 5th–4th century BCE*

The language of Plato, Aristotle, the tragedians. Not decoration — precision. Greek was built for philosophical exactness in ways English flattens. Compound words carry their etymology visibly; meaning assembles from parts.

χείρ (cheir) — *the hand that makes*. Root of χειρουργός (cheirourgos), hand-worker, surgeon.

μνήμη (mneme) — memory as monument. What remains. Root of mnemonic.

προσοχή (prosoche) — attention as *toward-holding*. πρός (toward) + ἔχω (to hold).

The structure invites precision that translation loses. θανατοχρωμία — death-color. ἡμερολόγιον — day-account. Each word a small philosophy.

---

<h2 id="ladder">[Ladder of Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_of_abstraction)</h2>

*S.I. Hayakawa, Language in Action, 1939*

Language operates at levels from concrete to abstract. "Bessie the cow" is concrete; "livestock" is abstract; "wealth" more abstract still. Each level loses detail but gains generality. Clear thinking requires moving deliberately between levels — knowing when to zoom in and when to zoom out. Muddy thinking happens when levels are confused.

Directly informs how work should function at multiple layers simultaneously. A belt is leather (concrete), an heirloom (abstract), attention made material (more abstract). Each layer true, none contradicting.

---

<h2 id="ardere">[Ardere](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ardere)</h2>

*Latin*

To burn. Not passion as emotion — passion as what survives testing. The name compresses: what remains after fire has tested it.

Root of ardent, ardor, arson. To burn is to transform irreversibly. What comes through the fire is changed but proved.

## Resonant Readings

Books that shape how attention is given.

**[Finite and Infinite Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games)** — James Carse, 1986. Finite games are played to win; infinite games are played to keep playing. Craft as infinite game: the point is continuation, not victory.

**[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions)** — Thomas Kuhn, 1962. Paradigms don't shift through gradual accumulation but through crisis and replacement. How frameworks become invisible until they break.

**[Metaphors We Live By](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By)** — George Lakoff & Mark Johnson, 1980. Metaphor isn't ornament — it's how thought works. "Argument is war" shapes how we argue. The metaphors we choose shape what we can think.

**[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)** — Robert Pirsig, 1974. Quality precedes the subject-object split. You know it before you can define it. The motorcycle doesn't care about your theories.

**[Gravity and Grace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_and_Grace)** — Simone Weil, 1947. Attention is the rarest form of generosity. Decreation as spiritual practice. The weight of the world and the lightness that comes from accepting it.

**[The Poetics of Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poetics_of_Space)** — Gaston Bachelard, 1958. Intimate spaces — drawers, chests, wardrobes — hold more than objects. They hold dreams. Material space as psychological architecture.

**[Tools for Conviviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality)** — Ivan Illich, 1973. Tools should serve human autonomy, not replace it. Industrial tools disable; convivial tools enable. The hand tool as political statement.

**[The Rings of Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rings_of_Saturn_(novel))** — W.G. Sebald, 1995. A walking tour that becomes meditation on decay, memory, and extinction. Prose that moves like thought itself — digressive, accumulative, melancholic.

**[The Book of Disquiet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Disquiet)** — Fernando Pessoa, 1982. Fragments from a life that preferred observation to participation. The aesthetics of incompleteness. Writing as the only authentic action.

**[So Long, See You Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_See_You_Tomorrow)** — William Maxwell, 1980. Memory, guilt, and the inadequacy of words to capture what happened. Slim, devastating, precise.
