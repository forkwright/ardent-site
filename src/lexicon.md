The ideas behind the work. Why we make what we make, how we think about craft, and the thinkers who've shaped the approach.

## Craft Philosophy

### Proofs and Refutations
*Process as proof — knowledge forged through dialogue*

[Imre Lakatos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_and_Refutations), 1976. Mathematics isn't discovered, it's constructed through conjecture and criticism. Theorems aren't found but forged through dialogue — conjecture, counterexample, revision. Knowledge emerges from the struggle, not despite it.

Directly informs *process as proof*: the work carries evidence of its making. The stitches are the argument.

### The Craftsman
*Craft as the pursuit of quality for its own sake*

[Richard Sennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Craftsman_(book)), 2008. The craftsman represents a basic human impulse: the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Skill develops through practice, repetition, and the hand-mind dialogue. The 10,000 hours aren't punishment — they're the path.

### Shop Class as Soulcraft
*Manual competence as philosophical inquiry*

[Matthew Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shop_Class_as_Soulcraft), 2009. Working with your hands isn't retreat from thinking — it's a different kind of thinking. The motorcycle doesn't flatter you. It responds to what you actually did, not what you meant to do.

### The Thinking Hand
*Knowledge in the hands, not just the head*

[Juhani Pallasmaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juhani_Pallasmaa), 2009. The hand has its own intelligence. Skilled making involves a fusion of hand, eye, and mind that can't be fully articulated. The hand knows what the mind hasn't yet understood.

### Tools for Conviviality
*Tools that enhance autonomy, not replace it*

[Ivan Illich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality), 1973. Tools should serve human autonomy, not disable it. Industrial tools create dependence; convivial tools enable self-directed action. The hand tool as political statement.

### Ladder of Abstraction
*Language operates at levels from concrete to abstract*

[S.I. Hayakawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_of_abstraction), 1939. "Bessie the cow" is concrete; "livestock" is abstract; "wealth" more abstract still. Clear thinking requires moving deliberately between levels. A belt is leather (concrete), an heirloom (abstract), attention made material (more abstract). Each layer true, none contradicting.

### Negative Capability
*The ability to sit with not-knowing*

[John Keats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability), 1817. "When a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason." The ability to hold opposites without collapsing them. Why *Aporia* is a dye color: some questions are meant to be lived, not answered.

### The Nature and Art of Workmanship
*Workmanship of risk vs. workmanship of certainty*

[David Pye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pye_(woodworker)), 1968. The outcome of the workmanship of risk depends on the skill of the maker at the moment of making — it can go wrong. The workmanship of certainty (jigs, molds, machines) predetermines the result. Hand work is risk. That's the point.

### Tacit Dimension
*We know more than we can tell*

[Michael Polanyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge), 1966. Explicit knowledge is the tip of the iceberg. Most of what the skilled practitioner knows can't be articulated — it lives in the body, in the hand, in the practiced eye. The craft reveals without containing.

### Small is Beautiful
*Economics as if people mattered*

[E.F. Schumacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful), 1973. Buddhist economics. Appropriate technology. Human-scale organization. The critique of "bigger is better" applied to tools, work, and meaning. What's lost when efficiency becomes the only metric.

## Systems & Recursion

### Gödel, Escher, Bach
*Strange loops and tangled hierarchies*

[Douglas Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), 1979. Self-reference, recursion, and the emergence of meaning from meaningless parts. How consciousness might arise from loops that point back at themselves. The book is itself an example of what it describes.

### Steps to an Ecology of Mind
*Patterns that connect*

[Gregory Bateson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_to_an_Ecology_of_Mind), 1972. Logical types. Meta-learning. The pattern which connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose. Systems thinking as a way of seeing relationships rather than things.

### A Pattern Language
*Design at multiple scales simultaneously*

[Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language), 1977. 253 patterns from regions to room corners. Each pattern solves a problem while creating context for smaller patterns. Design as nested solutions. The method applies to code, craft, and cities.

## Attention & Perception

### Phenomenology of Perception
*The body knows*

[Maurice Merleau-Ponty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_of_Perception), 1945. Perception isn't passive reception — it's active, embodied, skilled. "The hand remembers" is Merleau-Ponty. The body is not an instrument the mind uses; the body thinks.

### The Sovereignty of Good
*Attention as moral vision*

[Iris Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sovereignty_of_Good), 1970. Moral progress is learning to see clearly. Attention, properly directed, is a form of love. "The direction of attention is, contrary to nature, outward, away from self." Attention is a moral act.

---

## Aesthetic Traditions

### Wabi-sabi
*Beauty in impermanence and imperfection*

[Japanese aesthetic tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi), rooted in Zen Buddhism. What ages, wears, shows use is beautiful not despite the marks of time but because of them. Patina is a feature. Scars tell stories.

### Shibumi
*Understated elegance, quiet complexity*

[Japanese aesthetic tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibui). *Shibui* objects appear simple but reward sustained attention — the more you look, the more you find. Complexity that presents as simplicity. Restraint over ornamentation.

---

## Language & Etymology

### Attic Greek
*Precision that English flattens*

The dialect of [Classical Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_Greek), 5th–4th century BCE. Greek was built for philosophical exactness. Compound words carry their etymology visibly; meaning assembles from parts.

χείρ (cheir) — *the hand that makes*. Root of surgeon.
μνήμη (mneme) — memory as monument. What remains.
προσοχή (prosoche) — attention as *toward-holding*.

### Ardere
*To burn — what survives testing*

[Latin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ardere). Not passion as emotion — passion as what remains after fire has tested it. Root of ardent, ardor, arson. The name compresses the philosophy: transformation through fire, proof through survival.
