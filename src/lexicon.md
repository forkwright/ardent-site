<h1 data-greek="Λεξικόν"><span>Lexicon</span></h1>

The substrate beneath the work. External frames that shape how attention is given.

<h2 id="proofs">Proofs and Refutations</h2>

*Imre Lakatos, 1976*

Mathematics isn't discovered, it's constructed through conjecture and criticism. The process of proving is the proof. Directly informs *process as proof*: the work carries evidence of its making.

<h2 id="stoner">Stoner</h2>

*John Williams, 1965*

A quiet life fully lived. Every detail inevitable because it was attended to. Not performing depth — being deep. The kind of presence where the work simply becomes right because someone was fully there for it.

<h2 id="wabi-sabi">Wabi-sabi</h2>

*Japanese aesthetic tradition*

The beauty of impermanence and imperfection. What ages, wears, shows use. Not despite the marks of time, but because of them. Why patina is a feature, not a flaw.

<h2 id="shibumi">Shibumi</h2>

*Japanese aesthetic tradition*

Understated elegance. Complexity that presents as simplicity. The work that looks effortless because the effort was spent getting it right, not looking impressive. Direct restraint.

<h2 id="negative-capability">Negative Capability</h2>

*John Keats, 1817*

"When a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason." The ability to sit with not-knowing. Why *Aporia* is a dye color: the conundrum itself has beauty.

<h2 id="the-greek">The Greek</h2>

*Attic Greek, 5th century BCE*

Not decoration. Precision. Greek was built for philosophical exactness in ways English flattens.

χείρ (cheir) — *the hand that makes*. Root of χειρουργός (cheirourgos), hand-worker, surgeon.

μνήμη (mneme) — memory as monument. What remains. Root of mnemonic.

προσοχή (prosoche) — attention as *toward-holding*. πρός (toward) + ἔχω (to hold).

Greek compounds systematically. θανατοχρωμία — death-color. ἡμερολόγιον — day-account. The structure invites precision that translation loses.

---

<h2 id="ardere">Ardere</h2>

*Latin*

To burn. Not passion as emotion — passion as what survives testing. The name compresses: what remains after fire has tested it.

Root of ardent, ardor, arson. To burn is to transform irreversibly. What comes through the fire is changed but proved.
