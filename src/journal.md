Notes from the bench. What worked, what didn't, what I'm thinking about.

<h2 class="entry-title">The Cost of Naming</h2>
<p class="entry-date">2026-01-31</p>

I spent weeks on the dye names. Not the recipes — those took months. The names took longer to accept.

Aima. Thanatochromia. Aporia. Each one a compression. Blood, death's color, the stuck place. The words point at something, but they're not the thing. They can't be. Language flattens. That's what it does.

The red isn't blood. It's madder root simmered for an hour, iron mordant added grain by grain, watching the color shift as it oxidizes. It's the Roman boots and British saddlery that used the same chemistry. It's the hide absorbing what the plant gave up. Calling it "blood" loses most of that. Calling it "Aima" loses slightly less — the Greek holds sacrifice and lineage and cost in a way the English doesn't. But it still loses.

Every name diminishes what it names.

So why name at all?

Because the alternative is silence, and silence can't be shared. The work exists whether or not I compress it into words. But if I want someone else to see it — not understand it, just *see* it — I have to flatten it into something that fits in a mouth.

This is the cost of being seen: you become less than you are so that you can become visible at all.

I think about this when I stamp the date inside each belt. YYYYMMDD. Eight digits. A whole day reduced to numbers. But those numbers let the belt carry its birthday forward. Fifty years from now, someone might look inside and know: this one was made on a specific day by specific hands. The compression is lossy, but the alternative is no trace at all.

The dye names work the same way. Aima points at blood-cost-continuity-sacrifice. Most of that won't transmit. But some of it might. And if someone pauses on the word, wonders why it's Greek, looks it up — they've given attention. They've partially restored what the naming took.

Attention is the only thing that reverses the loss.

This is why I make things by hand instead of writing about making things. The object holds more than the description. The stitches don't compress — they just are. The grain doesn't flatten — it shows what it shows. The work carries what language can't.

But I still have to name the colors. I still have to write this down. The silence would be more honest, but no one would see it.

So I pay the cost. Aima. Thanatochromia. Aporia. Knowing each word is a wound to what it names.

The attention you give — reading this, holding the leather, noticing the stitch angle — that's what heals it.
