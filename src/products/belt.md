<p class="product-intro">Single layer. Hermann Oak harness. Solid brass.</p>

## Construction

Hermann Oak Old World Harness, 11-13oz. The same tannery supplying saddlemakers since 1881. One piece, no layers, no glue.

Solid brass heel bar buckle and dome cap chicago screws from Buckle Guy. The screws are replaceable. The keeper is hand-sewn from Wickett & Craig harness leather with Fil au Chinois linen thread.

Edges burnished. Holes punched and burnished. English tip.

Finished with Ardent wax: beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin. The leather is tallow-stuffed during tanning. Nothing synthetic.

Every belt is checked for stitch tension, edge finish, and hardware before shipping. Date stamped inside by the keeper.

## The Leather

Hermann Oak harness starts firm and softens with use. The vegetable tanning process produces leather that ages rather than deteriorates.

The hide carries the story of the animal that lived. Its scars, its shade. Minimal finishing lets that speak. The belt will darken as you wear it, recording your years the way the leather once recorded theirs.

## Sizing

Measure your current belt from the fold at the buckle to the hole you use most. Custom sizes available on request.

## Care

Wear it. The leather improves with use. No conditioning needed—the hide is already saturated with the oils it needs. If it gets wet, let it dry slowly away from heat.
