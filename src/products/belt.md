## Construction

Hermann Oak Old World Harness, 11-13oz. The same tannery supplying saddlemakers since 1881. One piece, no layers, no glue.

Abbey England Flat Whole Harness solid brass buckle from their 1832 Walsall foundry. Sand-cast using traditional methods. The buckle is hand saddle-stitched to the belt using Fil au Chinois 332 Sans thread. The keeper is hand-sewn from Wickett & Craig harness leather with the same thread.

Edges burnished and hot creased. Holes punched and burnished. English tip.

Finished with beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin. The leather is tallow-stuffed during tanning. Nothing synthetic.

Every belt is checked for stitch tension, edge finish, and hardware before shipping. Date stamped YYYYMMDD inside by the keeper.

## The Leather

Hermann Oak harness starts firm and softens with use. The vegetable tanning process produces leather that ages rather than deteriorates.

The hide carries the story of the animal that lived. Its scars, its shade. Minimal finishing lets that speak. The belt will darken as you wear it, recording your years the way the leather once recorded theirs.

## Sizing

Measure your current belt from the fold at the buckle to the hole you use most.

No belt? Measure around your body where you'd wear it. That's your belt size.

Custom sizes available on request.

## Warranty

Workmanship guaranteed. If it fails, we fix it.

## Care

Wear it. The leather improves with use. No conditioning needed. The hide is already saturated with the oils it needs. If it gets wet, let it dry slowly away from heat.
