## Construction

Hermann Oak Old World Harness, 11-13oz. One piece of leather, no layers. The fibers compress with use and the leather gets stronger over time.

Abbey England solid brass buckle from their Walsall foundry, sand-cast. The buckle is saddle-stitched to the belt with Fil au Chinois 332 linen thread. The keeper is Wickett & Craig harness leather, sewn with the same thread.

Saddle stitching uses two needles working the same thread from opposite sides. Each stitch locks into the next. If one breaks, the rest hold.

Edges are burnished - friction and pressure consolidate the fibers into a smooth surface. A hot crease defines the edge line.

Finished with beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin. The leather is tallow-stuffed during tanning.

## The Leather

Hermann Oak Old World Harness from their St. Louis tannery, vegetable-tanned since 1881. The surface shows the grain of the original hide - scars, shade, the texture of that particular animal. The belt darkens with handling over time.

## Sizing

Belt size is not pants size. Belt size is the actual measurement in inches.

Measure your current belt from the fold at the buckle to the hole you use most. Or measure around your body where you'd wear it.

Most people wear a belt 2" larger than their pants. Size 34 pants typically needs a size 36 belt.

Concealed carry? Add 1" to your measurement.

Available: 30" to 44" in 1" increments. Custom sizes on request.

## Warranty

Workmanship guaranteed. If it fails, we fix it.

## Care

The hide is already saturated with the oils it needs from tanning. If it gets wet, let it dry slowly away from heat.
