## Construction

The cover is a single piece of Wickett & Craig harness leather, skived thinner at the spine. The panels stay at 4oz. The spine comes down to about 2oz, feathering out on either side of the fold.

Five signatures of Midori MD Cotton paper, five folios each. A hundred blank pages.

The binding is woven long stitch. Thread passes along the outside of the spine between signatures, entering each one at five sewing stations. After all five are sewn, a second pass weaves through the exposed runs, interlocking them. The woven texture is visible on the spine.

Endbands are sewn at the head and tail before the cover goes on - linen cord wrapped with thread, anchored through each signature's center fold.

After binding, all three open edges are burnished with beeswax and agate stone. Compression and friction seal the paper fibers into a smooth surface.

Thread is Fil au Chinois 632, French linen, waxed, 0.51mm. Date stamped inside the back cover.

## The Paper

Midori MD Cotton. Eighty grams, cream, blank. Designphil has been refining this line in Japan since the 1960s. The cotton content gives the pages a softer feel under a pen than pure wood pulp, a warmer tone, and fibers that hold up over time.

## The Leather

Wickett & Craig Traditional Harness. Hot-stuffed with waxes and oils while the leather is still receptive, then jack-glazed under a glass cylinder. The cover after a few months of daily carry doesn't look like the cover when it shipped. It darkens where you hold it, softens where it folds.

## Warranty

Workmanship guaranteed. If the binding fails, we repair it.

## Care

The hide is already saturated with the oils it needs from tanning. If it gets wet, let it dry slowly away from heat.
