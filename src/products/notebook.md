## Construction

The cover is a single piece of Wickett & Craig harness leather, skived thinner at the spine so it folds without fighting. The panels stay structured. The spine flexes. That's the engineering - not a thinner leather chosen for convenience, but a heavier leather made right where it needs to give.

Five signatures of Midori MD Cotton paper, five folios each. A hundred blank pages. The paper is 20% cotton pulp, made by Designphil in Japan - they've been refining this stock since the 1960s. It takes ink without bleeding and pencil without smearing. A4 sheets folded to A5 with no waste.

The binding is woven long stitch. Thread passes along the outside of the spine between signatures, then a second pass weaves through the runs, interlocking everything. It takes twice as long as a standard long stitch. The weave means the signatures can't shift laterally, and if one run ever loosens, the others hold. You can see it on the spine - the woven texture is structural reinforcement that happens to be worth looking at.

Before the cover goes on, endbands are sewn at the head and tail. Linen cord wrapped with the same thread, anchored through each signature. These reinforce the two points where a notebook takes the most abuse - pulled from a bag, set on a shelf, carried in a hand. Commercial binderies skip this step and glue on a strip of colored fabric instead. The fabric does nothing. It's there to look like something was done.

After binding, all three open edges are burnished with beeswax and agate. The same principle as burnishing leather edges - compression and friction transform a raw surface into a finished one. The pages release cleanly. Dust and moisture meet a sealed edge instead of open fibers.

Thread is Fil au Chinois 632, French linen, waxed. The same maker as the belt's thread, scaled down for paper. 632 is correct for this weight the way 332 is correct for harness leather. The gauge matches the material, not a brand standard.

Date stamped inside the back cover.

## The Paper

Midori MD Cotton. 80 grams, cream, blank.

Blank because the notebook doesn't have an opinion about how you should use it. No lines, no dots, no grid. The paper quality speaks through what you put on it, not through what's printed on it before you start.

The cotton content gives it a softer feel under a pen than pure wood pulp. Warmer tone. Better aging. The kind of paper that belongs in a notebook you keep after it's full.

## The Leather

Wickett & Craig Traditional Harness. Hot-stuffed with waxes and oils while the leather is still receptive, then jack-glazed under a glass cylinder. It starts firm and structured, earns its softness through handling.

The same philosophy as the belt's Hermann Oak - leather that records your use rather than resisting it. The cover on day one hundred doesn't look like the cover on day one, and that's the point.

## Warranty

Workmanship guaranteed. If the binding fails, we repair it.

## Care

Use it. When it's full, it goes on the shelf. The leather cover and burnished edges will hold for decades.
