## Construction

One piece of Hermann Oak, folded at the corners and saddle-stitched with Fil au Chinois 332 Sans. No rivets. No snaps. No glue.

Fold lines worked with a bone folder. Edges burnished with canvas. 46 stitches total, four corners.

Date stamped on the underside.

## The Leather

Hermann Oak from their St. Louis tannery. Same harness leather we use for belts, skived thinner at the fold lines so it bends clean. Vegetable-tanned, tallow-stuffed. Finished with beeswax and neatsfoot oil.

Starts stiff. Softens where you touch it.

## What Fits

8" × 6" interior. 1.75" walls. Phone, wallet, watch, keys.
