## Construction

One piece of Hermann Oak Old World Harness, folded at the corners and saddle-stitched with Fil au Chinois 332 linen thread. Saddle stitching locks each stitch into the next - if thread wears through in one spot, the rest hold.

The fold lines are worked gradually with a bone folder. Heavy harness leather holds a shape once it's trained. The walls stay upright on their own.

Edges are burnished with canvas. The friction consolidates the leather fibers into a smooth surface.

## The Leather

Hermann Oak Old World Harness from their St. Louis tannery. 11-13oz, vegetable-tanned, tallow-stuffed. Finished with beeswax and neatsfoot oil.

## What Fits

8" × 6" interior. 1.75" walls. Phone, wallet, watch, keys.

## Care
