## Construction

One piece of Hermann Oak leather, folded at the corners and hand saddle-stitched with Fil au Chinois Lin Câblé 332 Sans thread. No rivets, no snaps, no glue. The corners are the structure.

The fold lines are worked by hand. The edges burnished and sealed. The base sits flat without reinforcement—the leather's own body is enough.

Date stamped YYYYMMDD on the underside.

## The Leather

Hermann Oak harness leather, the same we use for belts. Vegetable-tanned using methods unchanged since 1881. Tallow-stuffed during tanning, finished with Ardent wax: beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin.

The tray starts firm. Your hands, your objects, the oils they carry—these soften the leather where contact happens most. The base develops a patina. The corners hold their form. The whole thing becomes yours.

## What Fits

8" × 6" interior. Sized for a phone, wallet, watch, and keys—with room to spare. The 1.75" walls keep things contained without hiding them.

A quiet place for what you carry. Put things down at night. Pick them up in the morning. The ritual is the point.

## Warranty

Workmanship guaranteed. If it fails, we fix it.

## Care

Use it. The leather improves with contact. No conditioning needed—the hide is already saturated with the oils it needs.
