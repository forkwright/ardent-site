# Materials

Everything here was chosen for how it ages.

<h2 data-greek="Δέρμα"><span>Hermann Oak Leather</span></h2>

Hermann Oak Leather Company has operated in St. Louis since 1881. They vegetable-tan using oak bark. A process that takes weeks where chrome tanning takes hours.

The difference shows over time. Chrome-tanned leather stays the same until it fails. Vegetable-tanned leather develops patina, darkens with handling, molds to your shape. It ages.

Ardent uses their Old World Harness in russett at 11-13oz weight. Heavy enough to hold structure, supple enough to bend without cracking. The surface shows the grain of the original hide. No coating, no correction. Tallow-stuffed during tanning. Animal fat, not petroleum.

The russett color is natural - the result of oak bark and tallow, not dye. This is what vegetable-tanned leather looks like before anything is added.

[Botanical dyes](/dyes/) available in limited batches.

<h2 data-greek="Βυρσοδεψική"><span>Wickett & Craig Leather</span></h2>

One of two specialty vegetable tanneries left in the United States. Their Traditional Harness leather is hot-stuffed with waxes, oils, and tallows while still receptive, then jack-glazed: a glass cylinder compresses the grain and pulls waxes to the surface.

Firm, structured, high water resistance. Patina develops quickly. Ardent uses it for keepers and secondary components.

<h2 data-greek="Ὀρείχαλκος"><span>Solid Brass Hardware</span></h2>

Brass is copper and zinc. It oxidizes slowly to a darker patina that can be polished back or left to age. The same material used in nautical fittings, musical instruments, and ammunition casings. Chosen for durability in all of them.

All Ardent hardware is solid brass from Abbey England, a Walsall foundry operating since 1832 and holder of a Royal Warrant. Sand-cast, hand-stitched to the leather.

<h2 data-greek="Νῆμα"><span>Thread</span></h2>

Fil au Chinois Lin Câblé, French linen thread, waxed. Linen is stronger than cotton and more forgiving than polyester. Size 332 for leather, 632 for paper.

Hand saddle-stitching uses two needles working the same thread from opposite sides. Each stitch locks into the next. If one breaks, the rest hold.

<h2 data-greek="Τέλος"><span>Finish</span></h2>

Beeswax, neatsfoot oil, lanolin.

This protects without sealing. The leather can still breathe, still absorb and release moisture, still age naturally.

Nothing synthetic. Nothing that would need to be stripped and reapplied.
