## Launch Notification

<p class="launch-note">Ardent is pre-launch. To be notified when we open:</p>

<a href="mailto:contact@ardentleatherworks.com?subject=Notify%20me%20at%20launch" class="notify-link">notify me</a>

## Custom Work

Non-standard sizes or other requests. Reach out. Lead time depends on the work.

## Repairs

If our workmanship fails, we make it right. Stitching fails, we repair or replace at no charge. Hardware fails, replacement at cost plus shipping.

The leather itself is Hermann Oak. It's not going to fail for decades. Natural wear isn't a defect.

## Returns

If something is wrong with what you receive, get in touch. Ardent would rather fix it or replace it than have you own something that doesn't hold up.
