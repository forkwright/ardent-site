## Launch Notification

<p class="launch-note">Ardent is pre-launch. To be notified when we open:</p>

<a href="mailto:contact@ardentleatherworks.com?subject=Notify%20me%20at%20launch" class="notify-link">notify me</a>

## Custom Work

Non-standard sizes or other requests. Reach out. Lead time depends on the work.

## Repairs

If our workmanship fails, we make it right. Keeper stitching fails, we send a replacement keeper at no charge. Hardware fails, replacement at cost plus shipping.

The strap itself is single-layer Hermann Oak. It's not going to fail for decades. Natural wear isn't a defect. It's the work remembering you.

## Returns

If something is wrong with what you receive, get in touch. Ardent would rather fix it or replace it than have you own something that doesn't hold up.
