I've started things before. Projects, systems, attempts at making something that lasts. Most didn't survive long enough to matter.

This is the one that has to.

---

Leather, specifically. Not canvas, not wood, not any of the other honest materials I respect. Leather.

Because it cost something. An animal died. That's not incidental. It's central. The material carries weight that plant fibers don't. When I work leather, I'm accountable to that cost in a way I can't ignore.

Leather was skin. It carried an animal's life - scars, stretch marks, the particular texture of that creature's existence. When I work it, those marks are still there. I'm not erasing history. I'm continuing it.

The dyes I use are absorbed into the hide itself. Logwood and iron for deep red-brown. Madder root and time for purple. The chemistry is the same as centuries ago. When I dye a piece, I'm altering what it is, not what it looks like.

And when someone wears what I make, the leather continues changing. Their oils, their movement, their life gets absorbed the same way. The object becomes a record of partnership. It ages. It gets better.

Most things are designed to stay the same until they break. I wanted to make things that grow.

---

Hands, specifically. Not machines. Not even the good ones.

Because when I pick up an awl and push it through leather, the material pushes back. The stitch either holds or it doesn't. The edge is either burnished or it isn't. There's no layer where I can hide from whether I was actually present.

Physical skill accumulates in the body independent of conscious attention. The thousandth stitch teaches what the first stitch couldn't. The hands develop knowledge that the mind never fully accesses. I keep coming back to this because it's true in a way that's hard to explain and impossible to fake.

All hand tools. French knives, American edgers, brass and oak and thread. No machines between the hand and the work. The feedback loop stays direct.

---

The name comes from the Latin *ardere* - to burn.

Not passion. Not enthusiasm. The fire that tests.

I've abandoned a lot of things that didn't hold up. The ones that survived had something in common - they were actually true. Not performed. Not positioned. Just true.

That attention matters. That presence can be felt in objects. That the gap between intention and execution is where meaning lives or dies.

What remains after everything else burns away?

The things that were actually true.

This journal exists because the objects don't capture everything.

There are reasons behind the choices - why this leather, why this thread, why this stitching pattern. There are questions I'm working through that don't have answers yet. There are failures and recoveries that might matter to someone else trying to do something similar.

I'll write when I have something to say. Not on a schedule. Not for engagement. Just when the thinking needs to become words before it can become work.
