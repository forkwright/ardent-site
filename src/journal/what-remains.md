I've started things before. Projects, systems, attempts. Most didn't survive contact with my own mind.

This is the one that has to.

There's a way my brain works that I've spent most of my life trying to explain. It processes everything at multiple layers simultaneously - surface function, deeper structure, philosophical implication, the question of what survives. Not sequentially. All at once. Everything either resonates across all those layers or it repels. There is no neutral.

This sounds like a gift. Sometimes it is. Mostly it's *expensive*.

The cost is a translation layer I have to run constantly - converting how I actually think into something that fits normal conversation, normal commerce, normal life. The compensation tax. Cognitive overhead that others don't pay. By the end of most days I'm exhausted from a kind of labor that's invisible to everyone but me.

What exhausts me most is compression. Taking something that exists at five layers and flattening it to one so it can be communicated. Watching the meaning drain out as the words get simpler. Knowing that what arrives is not what I sent.

I've been misunderstood my entire life. Not because people are unkind - they're not. Because the translation is lossy and I can feel every dropped bit.

So why leather?

Because hands don't lie.

I can think in circles forever. I can build frameworks that explain everything and change nothing. I can have insights that evaporate before I can act on them. My mind is good at starting and bad at holding.

But when I pick up an awl and push it through leather, something different happens. The material pushes back. The stitch either holds or it doesn't. The edge is either burnished or it isn't. There's no layer where I can hide from whether I was actually present.

The hand remembers what the mind tries to forget.

That's not a tagline. It's the most true thing I know about making. Physical skill accumulates in the body independent of conscious attention. The thousandth stitch teaches what the first stitch couldn't. The hands develop knowledge that the mind never fully accesses. Craft is a way of knowing that doesn't require the translation layer.

When I'm stitching, I'm not compensating for anything. I'm just present. The overhead collapses. For a few hours, my mind works the way it's supposed to.

I chose leather specifically because it remembers.

I love canvas, cotton, linen - honest materials, all of them. But leather resonates differently. It cost something. An animal died. That's not incidental; it's central. The material carries weight that plant fibers don't. When I work leather, I'm accountable to that cost.

Leather was skin. It carried an animal's life - scars, stretch marks, the particular texture of that creature's existence. When I work it, those marks are still there. I'm not erasing history; I'm continuing it.

The dyes I use are absorbed into the hide itself, not painted on top. Logwood and iron for deep red-brown. Madder root and time for purple. The chemistry is the same as centuries ago. When I dye a piece, I'm altering what it is, not what it looks like.

And when someone wears what I make, the leather continues changing. Their oils, their movement, their life gets absorbed the same way. The object becomes a record of partnership. It ages. It gets better.

Most things in the world are designed to stay the same until they break. I wanted to make things that grow.

The name comes from the Latin *ardere* - to burn.

Not passion. Not enthusiasm. The fire that tests.

I've burned through a lot of versions of myself. Tried to fit systems that weren't built for minds like mine. The cost of that fitting - blunted by substances that others don't seem to need, treated by music that becomes the only language that doesn't require translation. Performed competence when I was drowning. Built elaborate structures that collapsed when my attention scattered. Failed in ways I don't talk about.

What remains after all that burns away?

The things that were actually true.

That attention matters. That presence can be felt in objects. That the gap between intention and execution is where meaning lives or dies. That I need to make things with my hands or some essential part of me atrophies.

That I have something to say and no good way to say it except through the work itself.

Ardent isn't a business plan. It's not a brand strategy. It's not content marketing or a side hustle or a retirement fantasy.

It's an answer to a question I couldn't stop asking: *What remains when you stop performing and start making?*

The answer, I think, is this: objects that carry evidence of presence. Work that doesn't require the translation layer because the truth is embedded in the material itself. Something I can point to when words fail - *here, this is what I mean. Hold it. Feel it. The work will tell you what I couldn't.*

I don't know if anyone else needs this. I know I do.

The belts and books and whatever comes after - they're not products I'm selling. They're artifacts of attention. Proof that someone was fully present for the hours it took to make them. Physical evidence that meaning can survive the compression of existing in the world.

For someone who has spent a lifetime being misunderstood, that matters more than I can say.

This journal exists because the work itself doesn't capture everything.

There are reasons behind the choices - why this leather, why this thread, why this stitching pattern. There are questions I'm working through that don't have answers yet. There are failures and recoveries that might matter to someone else trying to do something similar.

I'll write when I have something to say. Not on a schedule. Not for engagement. Just when the thinking needs to become words before it can become work.

If you're reading this and something shifted in you - some recognition, some resonance - then you're who this is for.

If not, that's fine. Not everything is for everyone. That's what makes the things that resonate feel true.

The work remembers whether I was present.

I'm going to make sure the answer is yes.
