# Attention Is a Moral Act

I say attention is a moral act. The more tangible reason is ten months old.

He doesn't know what I do for work, or that I make things from leather, or that I've spent years building systems to compensate for a mind that won't cooperate with itself. He knows warmth and faces and whether the person holding him is present or somewhere else.

He always knows.

I learned lessons as a child that took decades to unlearn. Some I'm still unlearning.

That worth comes from performance. That love is conditional on usefulness. That institutions keep their promises if you follow the rules. That the goal is to be so competent you become indispensable, because indispensable means safe.

None of it was true. I learned it anyway, and it shaped everything - how I work, how I love, how I fail. The patterns are deep enough that I catch myself repeating them even when I know better.

What if I teach him the same lies? Not through words - I know better than to say them out loud. Through behavior. Through the thousand small moments where he sees what I actually value versus what I claim to value. Children don't learn what you teach. They learn what you are.

---

I can't be there for myself most days. The overhead of existing in my own mind is expensive. By evening I'm often running on fumes, managing rather than living, getting through rather than being present.

How can I be there for him?

The question isn't rhetorical. I don't have an answer. I have the question, and I have the fear that the answer is: *you can't, not the way he deserves.*

---

I <strong style="color: #581523; font-style: italic;">despise</strong> feeling frustrated when I'm with him.

It happens when I'm trying to do something else - something I "need" to do, something with a deadline or a consequence. He needs attention and I'm calculating how to give him enough while preserving enough for the other thing. Dividing presence. Rationing attention.

He deserves someone who isn't rationing.

The frustration isn't at him. It's at myself for being pulled, at the world for demanding, at the whole structure of life that makes presence feel like a luxury rather than the foundation. But he doesn't know that. He just knows the person holding him is somewhere else.

---

There are fears I can name and fears I can't.

What if we pass on something hereditary - the wiring that makes everything harder, the patterns we didn't choose? What if he inherits the mind that processes everything at five layers and can't turn it off? What if he's too intelligent for his peers and spends his childhood alone, the way I did, wondering why connection is so easy for everyone else?

What if I fail him in ways I can't predict because I haven't healed them in myself yet?

---

The paradox is this: *I cannot fail. And I cannot fail.*

The first is the stakes. The impossibility of accepting any outcome where he is harmed by my limitations.

The second is the pressure. The impossibility of holding that weight without being crushed by it.

Same words. Different meanings. Both true. The tension between them is where I live now.

---

Day to day is management. Month to month is shocking - where did the time go, how is he already doing that, when did he become this person instead of that one? Ten months and I'm already projecting forward, wondering what man he'll become, whether I'll be someone worth having in that story.

The projection is a trap. I know this. The future doesn't exist yet; only this moment does. But my mind doesn't work in moments. It works in systems, patterns, trajectories. I can't help seeing where the lines lead.

Some of the lines scare me.

---

He's the most perfect thing I've ever played a role in creating.

Not perfect like flawless. Perfect like complete - a whole person, already himself, already someone I'm getting to know rather than someone I'm building. I thought parenthood was construction. It's not. It's witness. He's building himself; I'm just trying not to get in the way.

And trying to be present enough that when he looks back, he remembers someone who was actually there.

---

I make things from leather because attention is a moral act and the work remembers whether I was present. The belt holds evidence of the hours I spent on it. Quality emerges from presence, not effort.

Fatherhood is the same principle at stakes I can't calculate.

The child remembers. Not consciously, not in stories he can tell, but in his body, in his patterns, in what he learns to expect from love. He's absorbing everything - not what I say but what I am. The presence or absence. The attention or the rationing.

The work remembers. So will he.

---

I don't have a resolution. This isn't that kind of entry.

I have the weight, and I have the fear, and I have the knowledge that I'll keep showing up anyway because the alternative isn't an option. Some days I'll be present. Some days I'll be managing. Most days, probably, I'll be somewhere in between - trying, failing, trying again.

What I cannot fail is not a standard I can meet. It's a direction I face. The gap between what he deserves and what I can give is where the work happens.

The same as craft. The same as everything.

---

Ten months. A lifetime of moments ahead. I'm not ready, but readiness isn't the point.

Presence is the point. Showing up is the point.

I'll keep showing up.

And this. This is something I won't allow my mind to forget.
