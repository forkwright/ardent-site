The product page tells you what the belt is. Hermann Oak leather, Abbey England buckle, hand saddle-stitched. Dimensions, materials, price.

This is about why.

I chose single-layer construction because I've seen layered belts come apart. Two or three pieces bonded together, the glue fails where the belt flexes most, right where it wraps around your body every day. A single layer of harness leather doesn't have that failure mode. The fibers compress with use instead of pulling apart.

---

Hermann Oak has been tanning leather in St. Louis since 1881. Vegetable tanning takes weeks where chrome tanning takes hours. The difference only shows over months and years, which is the timeline I'm interested in.

The hide carries the marks of the animal that wore it first. Scars, variations in grain, differences in shade. The belt arrives with a history already in progress.

---

The buckle comes from Abbey England, a Walsall foundry operating since 1832. Sand-cast brass. The casting marks are still visible in the finished piece.

---

Saddle stitching uses two needles working the same thread from opposite sides. Each stitch locks into the next. If one breaks, the rest hold. It's slower. Every stitch is a decision to keep going, to maintain tension, to place the needle precisely.

---

Edges are burnished rather than painted. Burnishing transforms the leather itself - friction and pressure consolidate the fibers into a smooth surface. There's nothing to peel because nothing was added.

---

The price is $150. Materials cost $32. Labor and workshop time is $108 for roughly two and a half hours of work. Shipping is $10.

I publish this because I'd rather show costs than claim value. If the belt seems expensive, the breakdown explains where the money goes. If it seems reasonable, the breakdown confirms there's no hidden margin.

---

None of these choices are the only right choices. You could make a good belt with different leather, a different buckle, machine stitching, painted edges. It would be a different object.
