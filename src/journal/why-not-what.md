The product page tells you what the belt is. Hermann Oak leather, Abbey England buckle, hand saddle-stitched. Dimensions, materials, price.

This is about why.

Most belts are layered. Two or three pieces of leather bonded together, sometimes with a filler between them. It's efficient - you can use thinner, cheaper cuts and glue them into something that feels substantial. It works for a while. Then the layers separate. The glue fails where the belt flexes most, right where it wraps around your body every day. The failure is invisible until it isn't.

A single layer of harness leather doesn't have that failure mode. There's nothing to delaminate. The fibers compress with use instead of pulling apart. The belt doesn't hide its construction because there's nothing to hide.

I chose single-layer because I don't want to sell something that will fail in a way I can predict.

Hermann Oak has been tanning leather in St. Louis since 1881. This isn't heritage marketing - it's a practical choice. Vegetable tanning takes weeks where chrome tanning takes hours. The difference shows over time: chrome-tanned leather stays the same until it fails; vegetable-tanned leather develops patina, molds to shape, gets better. It ages.

I could source cheaper leather. The belt would look the same on day one. But I'm not optimizing for day one.

The hide carries the marks of the animal that wore it first. Scars, variations in grain, differences in shade. Minimal finishing lets that speak. The belt arrives with a history already in progress.

The buckle comes from Abbey England, a Walsall foundry operating since 1832. They hold a Royal Warrant. The brass is sand-cast using methods older than anyone working there.

A buckle from overseas would cost $6 instead of $18. It would be die-cast or stamped, finished to hide the process. It would work fine.

But the buckle is what you see. It's what your hands touch when you dress. I want that contact to be with something real - sand texture still visible in the brass, casting marks that prove a process happened. The buckle tells you what kind of object this is before you examine anything else.

Saddle stitching uses two needles working the same thread from opposite sides. Each stitch locks into the next. If one breaks, the rest hold. Machine stitching runs a single thread in a chain - one break and the whole seam unravels.

It takes longer. That's the point.

The time is where the attention lives. Every stitch is a decision to keep going, to maintain tension, to place the needle precisely. The belt carries that attention the same way the leather carries the animal's life. You can't fake it. You can't shortcut it. The stitches either hold or they don't.

---

The edges are burnished, not painted. Edge paint is faster - you brush it on and it hides imperfections. But it's a coating. Coatings crack, peel, wear through to reveal what's underneath.

Burnishing transforms the leather itself. Friction and pressure consolidate the fibers into a smooth, permanent surface. There's nothing to peel because there's nothing added. The edge IS the leather, finished rather than covered.

The price is $150. Materials cost $32. Labor and workshop time is $108 for roughly two and a half hours of work. Shipping is $10.

I publish this because I don't want to claim value - I want to show costs. If the belt seems expensive, the breakdown explains where the money goes. If it seems reasonable, the breakdown confirms there's no hidden margin extracting more than the work deserves.

The alternative is "premium positioning" - charge what the market will bear, justify with brand story, obscure the actual economics. I've bought those belts. The marketing was better than the product.

---

None of these choices are the only right choices. You could make an excellent belt with chrome-tanned leather, a stamped buckle, machine stitching, painted edges. It would be a different object encoding different values.

This belt encodes what I actually believe: that materials carry history, that construction should be honest, that attention is a moral act, that objects can hold meaning beyond their function.

The work remembers whether I was present. I want the answer to be yes.
