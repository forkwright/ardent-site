There's a word I keep returning to. Greek, like the others. But this one isn't a color named for what it carries. It's a condition named for what it can't resolve.

Aporia. The impasse when two truths contradict and neither yields.

I chose it for the green dye because green on leather was historically elusive. Most formulas faded fast or turned brown within a year. The chemistry is unstable in a way that red and purple aren't. Getting green to hold requires balancing ingredients that want to go somewhere else.

Logwood base with iron, overdyed with indigo. Iron pulls toward earth - permanence, weight, brown. Indigo pulls toward sky - transcendence, blue, light. The logwood mediates between them. The color shifts depending on how you look at it. Blue in bright light. Purple in shadow. Green that breathes.

The dye can't decide because the ingredients won't let it. The tension is the color.

Every choice in craft encodes tensions that don't fully resolve.

Single-layer versus bonded. The single layer is more honest, but the bonded construction lets you use thinner cuts and hide imperfections. Both are valid. Both encode different values about what you're willing to show.

Hand stitch versus machine. The hand stitch is stronger and more beautiful, but it takes ten times longer. At some point the time becomes a cost that the customer pays. Where's the line between integrity and indulgence?

Hermann Oak versus cheaper alternatives that look the same on day one. The difference only shows over years. You're asking someone to trust you about a future they can't verify. Every sale is an argument about time that you can't win with evidence.

I can't resolve these tensions. I can only choose and live with the choice. The object becomes a statement whether I intend it to or not. There's no neutral position.

Keats called it negative capability - being capable of uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without irritable reaching after fact and reason.

I think he understood something I'm still learning. The reaching is the problem. Resolution isn't the goal. Some questions are meant to be lived with, not answered.

The green shifts depending on how you look at it. That's the most honest thing about it. The color doesn't pretend to be one thing. It holds the tension in the dye itself.

That's what I'm trying to make. Objects that hold tension without pretending the contradictions are resolved. Work that shows what it cost to get here.

The color can't decide. I don't think it's supposed to.
