Weeks on the dye names. Not the recipes, those took months. The names took longer to accept.

Aima. Thanatochromia. Aporia. Each a compression; blood, the color death leaves behind, conundrum of action. The words point at something, but they're not the thing. They can't be. Language flattens to allow communicability but at what cost? Every act of naming is a choice to lose something in exchange for being understood.

This is why the language matters. Not as decoration, not as branding, but as the *mattering* itself. Every word on this site is a choice. The phrasing, the rhythm, what's said and what's left. Laziness is a choice, a deliberate decision to spend attention elsewhere or not at all. There is no neutral. Every syllable either resonates or it doesn't.

The ancient Greek isn't here to present as scholarly. It's here because Greek was built and evolved for this kind of precision. χείρ · μνήμη · προσοχή. Hand, memory, attention. Three words. A simple structure. But Greek carries millennia of contemplated meaning in its roots. The words combine systematically, layer on layer. What looks simple opens the longer you look. That's what real language does, it works at the surface and it works at depth, and neither layer betrays the other, accessible to those that choose to give attention.

A word that only means one thing is a label. A word that resonates is true at every level you read it. No loss between the surface and the foundation. The compression doesn't cost you anything because the word was chosen to hold what it holds.

Aima is not red. It is the cost of continuity. If that phrase works, it's because both readings are true simultaneously. The literal and the layered occupy the same space without contradiction. That's what I'm reaching for with every name, every sentence, every choice of what to include and what to leave out.

The red itself isn't blood. It's madder root simmered for an hour, iron mordant added grain by grain, the color shifting as it oxidizes. It's the Roman boots and British saddlery that used the same chemistry centuries ago. It's the hide absorbing what the plant gave up. Calling it Αἷμα compresses all of that into four letters. Most of it won't transmit. But if the word was chosen well, that is - if it resonates, then someone pausing on it, wondering why it's Greek, looking it up, sitting with it, can recover some of what was lost.

Attention is the only thing that reverses the compression.

This is why I make things by hand instead of just writing about making things. The object holds more than the description ever could. The stitches don't flatten, they just are. The grain doesn't compress, it shows what it shows and what it shows is a life lived. The work carries what language can't. But I still have to name the colors. I still have to write this down. Silence would be more honest, but silence can't be shared.

So the cost is paid. Aima. Thanatochromia. Aporia. Knowing each word is a wound to what it names.

The attention you give - reading this, holding the leather, noticing the stitch angle, pausing on a word you don't recognize - that's what heals it.
