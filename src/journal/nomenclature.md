<h1 data-greek="Ὀνοματοθεσία"><span>Nomenclature</span></h1>

This is how I think about naming. Not brand strategy. Something closer to how meaning gets made. The structure came first; the names followed.

## Dimensional Resonance

Names should be equally true at varying levels of abstraction without obvious pretension. A name that works only at one layer is a label. A name that opens as you look is an artifact.

Take *Ardent*. At surface level: burning, passionate. Etymologically: from *ardere*, to burn. At depth: what remains after the fire has tested it. The name works whether you stop at the first meaning or keep looking.

This is the test: Does the name satisfy casual inquiry while rewarding deeper attention?

## Why Greek

Ancient Greek was engineered for philosophical precision. It offers:

**Productive compounding.** Roots, prefixes, and suffixes combine systematically. You can build words that mean exactly what you need.

**Philosophical depth.** Terms carry millennia of contemplated meaning. When you use them, you're joining a conversation.

**Unfamiliarity as feature.** Prevents surface-level assumptions. Requires engagement. You can't pattern-match to something you already think you know.

**Aesthetic density.** Meaning compressed into sound.

Greek rewards contemplation while remaining practically accessible. Each term has a precise conceptual address.

## What You're Actually Naming

Not things. Not even essences. Modes of attention.

The taxonomy doesn't contain expertise. It reveals expertise that was latent in the data. The craft doesn't produce goods. It preserves attention. The system folders don't organize files. They organize relationship to domains.

When I name something, I'm asking: What way of seeing does this enable? Not what it is, but what it does or reveals.

## The Method

**Gnomon** (γνώμων) illustrates how this works. It names a medical code taxonomy for physician expertise matching.

| Layer | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| L1 | An indicator that shows physician expertise from claims data patterns |
| L2 | The part of a sundial that casts the shadow. Reveals time without containing it |
| L3 | A carpenter's square. Finds the true line the material will hold |
| L4 | That which makes knowing possible without itself being the knowledge |

The taxonomy doesn't create physician expertise. It reveals patterns already latent in the data. Like a sundial's gnomon: doesn't create time, makes visible what was already passing. Like a carpenter's square: doesn't impose structure, finds the true line.

The name works because it captures the function at every level of description.

## Building Blocks

Greek builds systematically from roots, prefixes, and suffixes.

**Roots carry the semantic core:**

| Root | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| γνω- (gno-) | knowing |
| σκοπ- (skop-) | watching, examining |
| φαν- (phan-) | showing, bringing to light |
| θεωρ- (theor-) | contemplating, beholding |
| ποι- (poi-) | making, creating |
| ἐργ- (erg-) | work, function |

**Prefixes modify relation:**

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| συν- (syn-) | together, with |
| ἀνα- (ana-) | up, again, throughout |
| δια- (dia-) | through, across |
| μετα- (meta-) | beyond, after, change |
| αὐτο- (auto-) | self |

**Suffixes determine grammatical function:**

| Suffix | Function |
|--------|----------|
| -ια/-εια | abstract state (ἀλήθεια: truth) |
| -σις | process, act of (ποίησις: making) |
| -τική | art, capacity (ῥητορική: rhetoric) |
| -μα | result of action (σχῆμα: form) |
| -ων/-μων | agent, one who (γνώμων: indicator) |

With these pieces, you can construct words that mean precisely what you need.

## Four Examples

**Dianoia** (διάνοια): thinking-through. Plato's divided line places it as the second-highest cognition, below direct insight, above belief. The mode of mind that must traverse. Cannot skip to conclusion. For systems that require working-through rather than immediate apprehension. Anything that honors the journey over the arrival.

**Aletheia** (ἀλήθεια): truth, but literally un-concealment. Truth as the process of revealing what was hidden, not a static property to possess. What you protect; the core that can be seen but not reduced.

**Energeia** (ἐνέργεια): being-at-work. Aristotle's actuality versus potentiality. Where intention becomes action. The bridge between thought and effect. For anything that actualizes rather than merely stores.

**Metaxynoesis** (μεταξυνόησις): Sometimes a concept needs a word that doesn't exist yet. Greek gives you the pieces to build it.

| Layer | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| L1 | Thinking that happens between |
| L2 | Cognition in the gaps, not in the nodes |
| L3 | Understanding that requires relationship to exist |
| L4 | The structured between-space as cognitive substrate |
| L5 | Topology that thinks |
| L6 | Intelligence as what emerges from the topology |

From μεταξύ (metaxy, "the between") + νόησις (noesis, "understanding"). Neo-Greek, because the concept needed a name.

## The Process

When naming something new:

1. Identify the mode of attention. What way of seeing does this enable?
2. Find the core action. Not what it is, but what it does or reveals.
3. Check dimensional resonance. Does it work at surface level through philosophical depth?
4. Test pronunciation. Can you say it without thinking?
5. Test explanation. Does the simple meaning satisfy casual inquiry?
6. Test depth. Does deeper inquiry reveal more rather than less?

**Common failures:**

Naming too early. Let the project reveal its nature before fixing the name.

Over-precision. A name that only works at one layer is brittle.

Pretension. If explaining the name feels like showing off, it's wrong.

Forcing fit. If you have to argue why it fits, it doesn't.

## The Gnomon Test

Ask: Does this name reveal without containing? Does it indicate something that was already there, or does it impose structure that wasn't?

The best names are gnomons. They cast shadows that show the shape of what they name.

This document is a gnomon. It indicates the naming system without containing it.
