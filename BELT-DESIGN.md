|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Current:** Natural brass | #10174 | $4.34 | Default |
| Nickel plate | #10174 NP | ~$4-5 | Silver look, wardrobe versatility |
| Nickel matte | #10174 NMR2 | ~$5 | Brushed silver, less shiny |
| PVD Black matte | #10174 PVD | ~$5.75 | Black hardware option |
| Antique brass | #10174 AB | ~$4 | Aged/patina look |

Note: Buckle Guy doesn't carry true stainless steel in this style. Nickel plate on solid brass is the closest for silver/corrosion resistance.
